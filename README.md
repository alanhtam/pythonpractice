Python Practice
==============

The purpose of this repository is to track my personal python learning. The solutions found here are for the most part original,
though some may be derived from solutions found on stack or elsewhere. I've attempted to attribute any influence from other
sources within the code.

Running list of completed exercises:
* cypher
* dice
* tictactoe
* unit calculator - challenge 173 from /r/dailyprogrammer (easy)
 
Ongoing:
* Think Python textbook
* Codewars: http://www.codewars.com/users/alanhtam
