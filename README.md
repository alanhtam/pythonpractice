Python Practice
==============

The purpose of this repository is to track miscellaneous python learning. The solutions found here are original,
though some are derived from solutions found on stack or elsewhere. I've attempted to attribute any influence from other
sources within the code.

Running list of completed exercises:
* cypher
* dice
* tictactoe
* unit calculator
* look and say
 
Ongoing:
* Think Python textbook
* Codewars: http://www.codewars.com/users/alanhtam
